This is a folder I will place mini experimental programs. Some are repeat code from online/offline books that I tested.

The files itself have descriptions.

So far I have

littleText.py - experiment from learn python the hard way resource I believe exercise 16
piChallenge.py - experiment from stack overflow question that calculates pi to a number of decimal places
